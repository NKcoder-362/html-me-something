    <p>One of my favorite places to visit in St. Louis is the Zoo.
    I am proud that our city continues to offer this as a free resource.
    It is difficult to pick which exhibit I enjoy most.  I know many people
enjoy the penguin house (especially on hot days).  I very much enjoy the
water animals (seals, penguins, polar bears) but I can't resist interacting
with the primates.

    <p>While the St. Louis Zoo has the animals, Missouri Botanical Gardens
    is the place to experience the plant life.  I also enjoy taking the small
    children in my life so they can enjoy the playground and feeding the fish.
    The Garden also has times when residents of St. Louis City/Co. have free access
    to the Garden.

    <p>Whenever relatives come to town there are three places I always
    take them, Amighettis and Ted Drews.  That being said, St. Louis has
a wide variety of places to eat.  I remember my Uncle asked me to take
him to White Castles when he came to town.  Having grown up here, he has
    fond memories of their burgers.  Whether you enjoy Italian, Mexican, German,
    French, Chinese, Tai, I could go on, you can get it here.<br>
